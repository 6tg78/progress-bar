## Mini web project using HTML/CSS and JavaScript

### _ At the moment, I have created the blur countdown effect when loading site. _ _ When we are in there is simple progress bar, that you can interact with use of two _ buttons.

### \* I will be expanding this weekly with stuff that I have learned.

### \* Deployed using Netlify: https://blurred-progress-bar.netlify.app/
