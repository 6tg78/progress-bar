## Mini web project using HTML/CSS and JavaScript

#### At the moment, I have created the blur countdown effect when loading site. When we are in there is simple progress bar, that you can interact with use of two buttons.

#### I will be expanding with stuff that I have learned.

#### Deployed using Netlify: https://blurred-progress-bar.netlify.app/
